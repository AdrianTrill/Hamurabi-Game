# **Hamurabi - Ancient Kingdom Simulation Game**

### Overview

**Hamurabi** is a Python-based strategic simulation game that challenges players to manage resources effectively as they rule over an ancient kingdom. As the ruler, you must balance grain reserves, land acquisition, and population growth while facing random events like harvest fluctuations and rat infestations. Your objective is to keep your people alive and prosperous over several years, making crucial decisions about feeding your population, planting crops, and buying or selling land.

### Key Features

- **Resource Management**: Allocate grain to feed your people and plant crops while managing land acquisitions and sales.
- **Random Events**: Randomized harvest rates, rat infestations, and fluctuating land prices keep the gameplay unpredictable.
- **Multiple Endings**: The game offers different outcomes based on your decisions, from population prosperity to starvation endings.
- **Replayability**: Random elements ensure no two games are alike, enhancing replay value.
